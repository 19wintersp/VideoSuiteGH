### Versions

The current stable releases and source code are kept on the master branch.

Each project has an InDev branch, called *"[projectName]-indev"*. Commits to the source code should be pushed to the relevant branch, however large features can be given their own branch in the format *"[projectName]-indev-[featureName]"*. The version number is shown as the "Current InDev version".

When an InDev version is nearly complete, it will be merged to the release branch, called *"[projectName]-release"*, and its status becomes "BETA". Its version is shown as "Next release".

A finished BETA version is finally merged into master, and its version number will be shown as the "Latest release". Bugfixes will take place on branches with format *"hotfix-[bugName]"*.
